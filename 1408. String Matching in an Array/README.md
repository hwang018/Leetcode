Given an array of string words. Return all strings in words which is substring of another word in any order. 

String words[i] is substring of words[j], if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of words[j].

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

Idea:
O(n^2) solution. Need 2 loops
for each work, check if it's substring of another word.
