Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Idea:
using the sorted nums array, the index of unique element (first encounter) is the number of elements smaller than this number.
