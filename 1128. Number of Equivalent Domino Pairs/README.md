Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a==c and b==d), or (a==d and b==c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.

Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].

 

Example 1:

Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
 
Idea:
We can sort each pair, and count the occurrence of same pairs in list of list.
Then we apply n choose 2, to get the number of combinations we can have.
Slow solution.
