Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Idea:
Slow solution but accepted:
using a while loop, iteratively pop and append this element to the 0-index position in nums.
only need O(1) space for the temp value.
